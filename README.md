#First-Blog-Website
Hi!

My name is Zac Gilfoyle.

## Description
This repository contains files for my first blog website. On this website you can enter blog information that is stored locally and is restored upon refresh or moving between pages. 

Along with this the pages contain some light and dark mode functionalies.

This website is a demonstration of knowledge for the Document Object Model or DOM.

Below is an image and link of the form which you can input information that will be displayed once it is posted.
